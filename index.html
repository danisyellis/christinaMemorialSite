			<h4>In Loving Memory</h4>
			<h1>Christina Jenkins</h1>
<div id="obit">
			<p>Christina Melissa Jenkins’ brilliant, fierce light burnt out on November 5th, while volunteering in Peru.  She was 40 years young.</p>  

			<p>Christina was born in Lynn, MA, graduated from Lynn English High School, and went on to the University of New Hampshire and Lesley College. After many years in the Greater Boston area, she relocated to Berkeley, California, in 2009, which she grew to call home. </p>   

			<p>Christina didn’t do anything halfway - she dove headfirst into what sparked her passion. She thrived on change, and never shied away from a challenge. Spending the last 3 months helping abused women and children in Cusco, Peru, was just a small part of her commitment to trying to make the world a better place for us all.  </p> 

			<p>Professionally, she was admired and adored as an Office and HR Manager, known for her ability to solve any problem and smooth over difficulties.  The highlight of her career was coordinating and editing a legal brief that was submitted to, and used by, the Obama administration in the immigration policy reforms of 2014. Outside of work, Christina contributed, with both time and money, to organizations committed to improving the lives of others - the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Occupy movement, Black Lives Matter and Justice Together. Anyone who met Christina quickly learned that what Christina loved most was helping people. Her family, friends and community were a vital part of who Christina was - laughing, loving, cuddling, and listening to music were to be expected if you were in her company.</p> 

			<p>Christina took to languages, and was proficient in both French and Spanish, and was known to speak the language of her cat, Sami.</p> 

			<p>Christina loved her neighborhood and all that was contained within it - with countless photos of the beautiful details to show for it. She was an avid reader, and enjoyed everything from quick-read YA novels to epic fantasy tomes, brain-bending postmodern novels and moving poetry.  Christina’s music tastes varied as widely as her literary ones - she loved listening to Dave Matthews Band and Mumford and Sons as much as she did bouncing to Lady Gaga and Avicii, with myriads of folk, rock and electronic artists in regular rotation.  Her cooking and baking skills were legendary among her friends, whether it would be for an elaborate dinner party, an hors d'oeuvres spread for a party or soup delivered to someone who wasn’t feeling well.</p> 

			<p>Christina was predeceased by her mother, Diane Boudreau Olivero. She is the daughter of Harold Jenkins, of Lecanto Florida, the devoted sister to Elizabethe Davis and her fiancé Michael Consoletti of Watertown.  She was the loving aunt to Bianca Davis of E. Falmouth, Cassidy Davis of Watertown, and Ryleigh Davis who resides at The University of Maine in Orono.  Also grandnieces Aria and Madelynn both of E. Falmouth.</p> 

			<p>Christina also leaves behind a very loving, devoted and devastated chosen family: Daniel Garcia and Yulia Krashennya of Berkeley, CA, Josh Huber and Tori Sweetser of Cambridge, MA, Rosa Carson of Somerville, MA, Mark Kriegsman of Arlington, MA, and Philip Katz of New York, NY</p> 

			<p>There are aunts, uncles and cousins that will miss her as well.  </p> 

			<p>There will be two memorial services to celebrate her life, to try and accommodate all those that loved her:</p> 

			<p>Saturday, December 3rd, 1pm: <a href="http://hot.anyvite.com/events/home/dgjthlwoes" target="_blank">Temple of Remembrance at Paradise Ridge,</a> 4545 Thomas Lake Harris Drive, Santa Rosa, California 95403 </p> 

			<p>Saturday, December 10th, 10am: <a href="http://concordscouthouse.org/" target="_blank">Concord Scout House,</a> 74 Walden Street, Concord, MA 01742</p> 

			<p>Please join us to celebrate her amazing life, and wear purple and glitter in her honor.  </p> 

			<p>Although Christina loved flowers, in lieu please consider donating to a charity that was very important to her: <a href="http://www.sfwar.org" target="_blank">SF Women Against Rape  (www.sfwar.org) </a></p>
